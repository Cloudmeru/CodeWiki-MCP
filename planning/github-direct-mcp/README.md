# GitHub Direct MCP (Separate Project) — Planning Docs

This folder contains product and technical planning for a **separate MCP server project** focused on direct GitHub repository querying **without git clone**.

## Scope Intent
- This is intentionally **not integrated** into CodeWiki-MCP.
- The new project acts as an additional retrieval layer for LLM agents.
- Target: public GitHub repos first, private repos later.

## Documents
- `PRD.md` — product requirements document
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — proposed system architecture
- `TOOLS_SPEC.md` — tool contracts and response format
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — phased delivery plan
- `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` — decisions to finalize before implementation
